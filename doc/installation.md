# Installation Instructions

The DCM is designed to work on linux systems, and should work on most unixes.
These instructions (*currently*) assume the system is being configured with ansible, and are configuring a CentOS 6 system which isn't being used for other purposes.
The docker image is currently experimental.

## Configuration
 - using `secrets.yml.template` as a template to create `secrets.yml`
 - configure the hostlist as appropriate
 - run the playbook

**TODO** install docs still need signficant improvement.
